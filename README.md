# Inspirit-AI-Anti-Immigrant-Text-Screener
Inspirit AI was a summer program that I participated in my sophomore year where we explored linear and logistic programming with Python. This was one of the programs we worked on in the program. The program is analyzing a dataset tweets to use keywords and tone detecting to classify them as xenophobic or not.
